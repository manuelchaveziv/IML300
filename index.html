      <h1>MANUEL CHAVEZ IV</h1>
      
      <p>
        This is Manuel's website for <i>IML300</i>. Manuel is studying Media Arts + Practice at the University of Southern California. His most recent work is understood through the lens of identity and cultural heritage. 
        Much of his professional creative output up until now has been centered around athletics. Creating visuals that tell meaningful stories, connect with audiences, and boost brand identity. A gritty grain texture sits atop almost every piece he creates. 
        He gravitate towards this style mainly because it makes the design feel tangible and grounds it apart from something that is purely digital. Much of his personal work delves into his experience as a second-generation Mexican-American. Specifically, the angst he's felt, having grown up being somewhat disconnected from his cultural heritage. His work today explores that disconnection, as if he's investigating a wound that's been open his whole life. As for his artistic practice, at the moment he's at a crossroads. Work seeped in meaning, driven by emotional stories, and creates an inspiring impact is what he seeks to create in the future. Nearly the entirety of his artistic output and practice has been developed through sports. He's reached a moment where the burning desire to create for athletic brands is no longer there. While this may be a symptom of creative burnout, nonetheless, he yearns to expand his creative horizons and abilities. Currently, his artistic practice is easily defined, but in the future, he wishes for it not to be. In the future, his work will inspire and incite change, it will tell meaningful stories, and it will be from a vast array of several different practices and mediums.

      <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
      <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
      <p> <br>Project 1 is inspired by stem splitting techniques used in audio production. It's often used for sampling and has been thoroughly improving in the development of AI. Stem splitting involves taking a fully mixed track and 'splitting' it into individual components. I used an AI stem splitting software to breakdown "Mayonaise" by The Smashing Pumpkins into four core components: The music, vocals, bass, and drums. </br>
          <br> Within the code, each slider is connected to a different audio component, so you have the option to toggle the volume for either or keep one and mute the others. For example, keep the music and vocals but mute the bass and the drums. </br>
          <br>Something that's missing is the ability to toggle the song in itself, as this project only allows you to play from beginning to end.</br></p>

      <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
      <p> <br>The aesthetics and narrative for my Project 2 are inspired by one of my favorite movies: The Matrix (1999). The narrative around my project is structured around the red or blue pill analogy, inspired by the scene in which Neo must choose which pill to swallow. He must decide his fate. </br>
          <br>My life and experiences always seep into the work I create. I believe it's natural to interpret my life as material. The title of my project, "METAMORPHOSIS," represents my current stage. Navigating through this period of "limbo," walking aimlessly along a path I no longer desire. METAMORPHOSIS is a culmination of the deep self-reflection I've gone through over the course of this semester -- even the course of this past year. </br>
          <br>The blue or the red pill is an ultimatum I present to myself. If I take the blue pill, I remain walking along the path set for me. I dread the journey, feeling the weight of every step. I remain content. Comfortable. Forever knowing I should have taken the red. The red pill symbolizes the contorting that is occurring within me. Facing the metamorphosis head-on, accepting the uncertainty that comes with it. This project is a peek into my psyche. </br>
          <br>I've always interpreted moments in my life, such as these, where changes occur as "shedding skin."  That is to say, I've worn many different skins over the course of my life, yet I carry remnants of each with me. When choosing either pill, a section appears where words sporadically shimmer onto the screen. These words recur in my reflection journals and notes to myself, describing the sporadic thoughts that permeate my mind during this experience. </br>
          <br>The ending of each fate displays a quote relating to the symbolism of each pill. The red pill's quote is from the film, which I interpret as "bending" yourself, taking control, and believing in your capabilities. The blue pill displays a quote by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, emphasizing that change is an inevitable part of life, whether we choose to shed skin or not. </br></p>

      <h2>Project 3: Networked Care</h2>
      <p> <br>A website dedicated to spotlighting the triumphs of immigrants in the United States.</br>
          <br>A place where descendants of immigrant families can share testimonies and personal stories of their grandparents, highlighting the enduring strength, courage, and resilience that runs deep in their veins.</br>
          <br>Additionally, a website serving as an educational/informational/call-to-action speaking out against the inhumane and unethical practices of ICE under the Trump administration.</br> 
          <br>Overall, highlighting the story of the immigrant and fostering community and empathy. </br></p>

       <p> Created a website that displays a live fruit tier list in the style of a stock market, where participants can vote on their favorite fruits and fruit combos. It's a live tier list, so the list will be shifting and rankings of fruits and fruit combos will change in real-time. Tried to give it more fun look, asking Claude for a 90s/2000s aesthetic website but it wasn't able to achieve my request.</p>
        
       <p><a href="https://web-echoes-of-soul.lovable.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > <b>Vibe Coding Experiment #2</b></a></p>
        <p> This was the prompt: Create a website that portrays the World Wide Web as a sort of gateway into the inner psychological workings of humanity. I went with a melancholy look, with gothic elements. Provide a tab of the most visited to websites on the world wide web, and provide a description to go along with why they're so popular. Have the descriptions be honest and from the perspective of someone looking upon, or down upon, the human race. Talk about what these websites take from us, not what they do. </p>
        
       <p><a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/57c16cd3-e17b-4ecd-8177-23d69abd95fa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > <b>Vibe Coding Experiment #5</b></a></p>
       <p> My vibe coding experiment for this week was inspired by the "In Defense of the Poor Image" readings. I ruminated on what it meant for an image to be considered "poor," in that its degraded quality signifies a life the image has lived as it travels throughout the public sphere in the digital realm. It's stated that poor images are "popular" images, in that they "can be made and seen by the many… a snapshot of the affective condition of the crowd, its neurosis, paranoia, and fear, as well as its craving for intensity, fun, and distraction." I considered how memes have emerged and evolved as a new form of communication as a "popular" image with the development of digital space and social media. Images whose degraded quality carries a sense of novelty.  Memes have been able to exist and survive in this space among people, as their popularity is generated by a sense of collective agreement within a community, and their shared meaning. This led me to consider where AI comes into play and whether AI-generated images could be regarded as "poor." Their ability to be generated instantly and mass-produced leans toward yes, but the images themselves are not "real." I thought specifically about AI image generation with the intention of creating a "meme," and how the Trump Administration has been utilizing AI-images as a modern tool of propaganda. How instantaneous the process is to generate discussion across all digital platforms. About how the government is infiltrating a space protected by the people to leverage the instantaneousness of AI to control the imagery and enforce ideology.</p>
      
       <p><a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/4580feec-c65a-4301-848c-42c657a67f16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > <b>Vibe Coding Experiment #7</b></a></p>
       <p>Design a website that demonstrates the exploitative nature of social media platforms – specifically, what these large digital tech giants gain from our presence on their services. When we share our work on their platform, what do they gain? What is being extracted? Think about the surveillance ingrained into the coding of these platforms, which then informs the algorithms. In the past, what you saw on social media was only because of who you followed. Today, much of what we see is a mix of who we follow and what the algorithm knows of our interests and the digital character it has created of us. Take this into account as well.
         For this website, I would like you to design it in the form of a vortex. Use this vortex as a symbol for posting on social media platforms, where dragging a file into the vortex is equivalent to hitting “Post” on Instagram. When something is added into the vortex, a new tab styled like lines of code appears, detailing how the platform is benefiting from your post. What information is it gathering about you? How much revenue is it generating? </p>

       <p><a href="https://alt-verse-weaver.lovable.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > <b>Vibe Coding Experiment #8</b></a></p>
       <p> For this vibe coding experiment, I picked “Alt-Text as Poetry” for my topic. I went with a simplistic approach, asking Lovable.ai to create a minimalist website focused solely on delivering poetic descriptions of images. In my prompt, I framed it to avoid delivering dull descriptions and to use as much vivid imagery as possible. I went with a minimalist approach for the attention being entirely directed to the descriptions being returned, having this section speak as opposed to the entire website.  </p>

       <p><a href="https://watchtower-usa-sim.lovable.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > <b>Vibe Coding Experiment #9</b></a></p>
       <p> My vibe code experiment for this week was inspired by an interview with Hamid Khan, centered on speaking out against the LAPD's use of algorithms for policing. I used Lovable to create a website that frames the United States as a website. The user must input their information, taking from all the necessary elements of a personal identification card. My instructions for Lovable were to create its own predetermined assumptions based on the input information. Part of this instruction was derived from the fact that algorithms are inherently biased, as discussed by Khan. However, I’m not sure about the internal process through which Lovable came to its conclusions. I then directed it to use the submitted answers to determine whether this person is “suspect” or “safe.” If they were deemed suspicious, I directed Lovable to present a pop-up that informs them they have been added to a list of people deemed “suspicious,” and that their existence is now subject to government surveillance. For artistic flair, I added a set of eyes at the top, and on the nose, a reference to surveillance. I asked it to modify the set of eyes at the top of the page so that they are now glowing red, reminiscent of the red glow of a camera recording. If they are not deemed suspicious, remove the set of eyes mentioned earlier and inform the user that they are welcome to enter the USA.</p>

       <p><a href="https://stemwave-visualizer.lovable.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" > <b>Vibe Coding Experiment #10</b></a></p>
       <p> For this weeks vibe coding assignment, I took influence from DJ Dave and went back to the first project I completed in p5, which worked as a special "stem-splitter." Where the "stems" or layers of instruments and sounds throughout a song could be toggled. I did exactly that for this assignment, prompting Lovable to create a website where stem-splitting could be done with an emphasis on interactivity.</p>

      <h1>VIBE CODING REFLECTION</h1>
      <p> The vibe coding exercises were interesting. It was very difficult to prompt the AI to meet my exact vision in relation to the class readings.
          In my experience, I approached the AI as if it were a round ball of clay, and I had to sculpt it into what I was envisioning. 
          It was interesting to see how the AI's, both Claude and Lovable, interepreted my ideas. After prompting, there were always certain features I had to modify, or build upon after seeing what the AI generated. 
          I enjoyed being in idea conversations with the AI. Having one idea, seeing the AI's perspective, and going from there until reacing a result I liked was a fun part of the process. 
          I learned how to communicate my ideas to meet certain outcomes, but there were times I felt I was not concise with my prompts or with my goals.
